ros-indigo-moveit-ikfast (3.1.0-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * Search for cheapest IK solution
  * Specify search mode during code generation
  * Fix issue: min_count must be negative (negative direction was ignored!)
  * Added G.A. vd. Hoorn as second package maintainer
  * Fix for issue #34 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_ikfast/issues/34>: add liblapack-dev dependency to generated pkg manifest
  * scripts: add dependency on liblapack-dev to generated pkg manifest. Fix #34 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_ikfast/issues/34>.
  * Use getIkType() in getPositionIK()
  * Added support for the Translation3D-type IK
  * Fix for missing run_depends in generated pkg manifest
  * Make sure run_depends get added to pkg manifest as well. Fix #30 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_ikfast/issues/30>.
    Short-circuit evaluation of the statement determining the value of
    'modified_pkg' caused the second call to update_deps(.., 'run_depend', ..)
    to never happen. Using binary or to work around that.
  * Fixes for 23, 27 and 28
  * Eigen is not actually a dependency anymore, so remove build_dep on cmake_modules.
  * Remove dependency on deprecated tip_frame_ variable
  * scripts: any change to run or build depends should trigger manifest updating.
  * templates: include planning group name in plugin desc install rule. Fix #28 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_ikfast/issues/28>.
  * templates: remove superfluous link_directories(). Fix #23 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_ikfast/issues/23>.
  * templates: cmake_modules provides FindEigen, so explicitly depend on it. Fix #27 <https://github.com/davetcoleman/moveit_ikfast/issues/27>.
    Also change order of find_package(..) statements to reflect this and
    update dependency checking in pkg generator script to allow for different
    run and build depends (cmake_modules is only a build_depend).
  * Remove dependency on deprecated tip_frame_ variable (now supports multiple tip frames)
  * Added support for the Translation3D-type IK
    Modified the ikfast moveit template to work with OpenRAVE's
    Translation3D-type IK. This is useful for manipulators with few DOF
    (i.e., 3 or 4) that just want to go to a certain position without caring
    so much about the end effector's orientation.

ros-indigo-moveit-ikfast (3.0.5-0saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * use GetIkType() instead of #defines
    This removes the need to manually specify the IK type using #define
    IKTYPE_... and closes #5 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_ikfast/issues/5>.
  * Fix to check all depencies are in package.xml
  * Merge pull request #10 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_ikfast/issues/10> from ros-planning/auto_update_script
  * Merge pull request #9 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_ikfast/issues/9> from fsuarez6/master
    Fix IKfast plugin undefined symbol poseMsgToKDL
  * Check for file existance first
  * Added auto update script for keeping your plugin up to date with changes in the kinematics plugin format
  * Merge branch 'master' into multiple_plugins
  * Added tf_conversions dependency to expose its functions to the plugin (e.g. poseMsgToKDL)
  * fix whitespace
